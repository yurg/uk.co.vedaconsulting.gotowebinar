# GoToWebinar Integration for CiviCRM Events #

### Why the fork ### 
[GOTO API updates 2024: API Host and API Authentication Token Deprecation](https://developer.goto.com/guides/Authentication/New_Token_Retrieval_Migration_Guide/)

### Overview ###

CiviCRM Events can be integrated with GoToWebinar.

### Installation ###

* Install the extension in CiviCRM. More details [here](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/customize/extensions/#installing-a-new-extension) about installing extensions in CiviCRM.
* Configure GoToWebinar details in **Events >> GoToWebinar Settings** (civicrm/gotowebinar/settings?reset=1)

* Create an "app" on the GoToWebinar apps page. Setup Redirect URL : [https://yourwebsite.com]/civicrm/gotowebinar/settings. (replace yourwebsite.com with your website domain)
* Copy the **Client Key** and **Consumer Secret** into the settings page in CiviCRM.
* You will also need to use the username and password to log into the GoToWebinar website. The username and password will not be saved in CiviCRM.
* The authentication will get refreshed occassionally. It will attempt to reauthenticate when trying to fetch webinar information on event pages and on the settings page. If you see a notice that GoToWebinar is disconnected, first try to refresh the settings page. If that doesn't work you may need to provide your username and password again. That should be rare.
* After a successful authentication, a list of upcoming webinars will be fetched and displayed on the screen. (Note: first name, last name & email are the only fields that get pushed to the webinar for now. Webinars with additional mandatory fields will not get participants added from CiviCRM.)
